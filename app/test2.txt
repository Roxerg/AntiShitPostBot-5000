A's catcher Bruce Maxwell was arrested Saturday after a female food delivery driver accused him of pointing a gun at her, TMZ Sports first reported.

According to Scottsdale, Ariz., police, authorities went to Maxwell's home after receiving a call about a man with a gun. Maxwell was later booked on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct before being held in custody pending an initial appearance.

Maxwell made headlines earlier this year as the only MLB player this season to kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. He claimed last week during a visit to his hometown of Huntsville, Ala., that a pro-Trump waiter refused to serve him at a restaurant because of his peaceful protest.

Maxwell, 26, hit .237 with three home runs and 22 RBIs in 76 games this season.
