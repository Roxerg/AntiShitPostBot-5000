“21st Century Fox has taken concerted action to transform Fox News, including installing new leaders, overhauling management and on-air talent, expanding training, and increasing the channels through which employees can report harassment or discrimination," said a company spokesperson.

"These changes come from the top, with Lachlan and James Murdoch personally leading the effort to promote civility and respect on the job, while maintaining the Company’s long-held commitment to a diverse, inclusive and creative workplace.”

The latest New York Times report into Bill O'Reilly has raised fresh questions over whether the Murdoch-owned company should be granted the right to fully acquire Sky.

Media regulator Ofcom met with Fox executives to discuss the takeover on 18 April — a day before O'Reilly was sacked from Fox News.

According to the regulator's report into the discussions, Fox brought up the harassment allegations in recent years relating to former Fox News boss Roger Ailes and the network's biggest star Bill O'Reilly.

Ofcom flagged concerns with the corporate culture, but ultimately decided in June that 21st Century Fox was "fit and proper" to hold a British broadcasting licence.
